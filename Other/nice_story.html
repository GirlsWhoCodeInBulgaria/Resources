I dropped out and started learning programming after that because programming seemed like the only profession at the time that allowed you to make a living without a degree. I started as a freelancer/contractor, worked with a friend who was
into designing for a year, and then I went solo.<br/>Here is the "evolution of my skills":<br/>Earning-enough-money-to-take-care-of-myself: 5 months<br/>Honestly though, if I’d have just stuck to WordPress this would have happened
sooner.<br/>Entry-level-programmer-skills: 6-7 months<br/>I was capable of pulling my weight around a few PHP frameworks and jQuery, and I had become pretty decent at SQL, and was also able to design. And I bet that's much more than what
entry level programmers do.<br/>Advanced-noob-programmer-level: 12 months<br/>I was pretty decent in PHP and JavaScript by this time, and had just touched the surface of "application design."<br/>Veteran-programmer: 16 months<br/>This was
the time I started looking into architecture, and open source stuff in languages other than PHP and JS. I was capable of working in most parts of web-dev.<br/>Fuck-all-can-do-all-web-dev-thingy-programmer: 24+ months<br/>I can write awesome
PHP, JS, Python and somewhat decent Ruby, and can pick up new languages/frameworks within a week or two, for example, I started Java yesterday and implementing Backbone.js's model-collection data structure in Java to learn it (almost done),
also looking at socket programming in Scala. I have gotten pretty good at application design and architecture, and can do the job of several of your "standard" programmers alone. Oh, even gonna give a talk on this topic pretty soon: The
official Laravel Conference now in Europe!<br/>All this time, IRC helped me a lot, and networking, open source, etc, i.e., whatever Scott Danzig said. But I just had to share my timeline. :D<br/>Oh and I worked for foreign clients only
once, I stuck to freelancing locally because I knew I had to build up my "people skills" too.<br/>UPDATE:<br/>The above answer was written in mid-2013. Three more years have passed since then. Will add my progress since then. I have
developed something called humility since then, but still , very proud of my progress :)<br/>Talented full-stack dev turning into a proper Software Designer, 2014– mid 2015: years 3–4<br/>After my laraconEU talk. I got a good idea of what
it would be like to be a “celebrity developer”. I took a pause. I was about to turn 25, and figured that I can probably make having fun the major priority of my life for some time.<br/>It went well. I had the most reckless, scandalous type
of “fun” I could imagine. But it also caused a lot of problems in my personal life. Have cooled down for quite some time now.<br/>I also refined my software design skills. Re-tooled completely to ES-Next(Babel · The compiler for writing
next generation JavaScript) on node and react, picked up android, some machine learning for natural language processing (worked with nltk and stanford-nlp). Created an ORM(fractaltech/tabel) that I am proud of. Still have to properly
release it, using it in my own work though. Created several frameworks in different companies that I am proud of. Most of these frameworks were reused by developers who worked with me after they switched jobs.<br/>Most of all, hit a point
in software design where it was very hard for me to remove anything from the systems I was making, and anything that was added to these systems was simply a reflection of the business problem these systems were solving.<br/>Startup Founder,
mid 2015 - present: years 5–6<br/>Founded a startup with a college junior. We decided to do something together on 15th August 2015. the idea at that time was to build an industry-grade CMS for mobile-apps, an app-builder, so to say. It was
a pipe-dream, and we had no clue how to start on it, and we were waiting for android release of react-native(React Native | A framework for building native apps using React), which was going to happen in Oct 2015.<br/>Amidst learning all
the new concepts that came with react-native, we were figuring out all the business angles of what we were trying to build, and arranging funds/side-gigs to continue financing our bootstrapping phase.<br/>In Nov-Dec 2015, we fixed upon a
“path” of sorts towards building the “app-builder”. The first milestone of that “path” was building a “form-building-app”. We got designs done for the “form-building-app” in Jan, Started development in Feb. And in first week of June,
released FormApp(FormApp - Android Apps on Google Play).<br/>We talked to a lot of people about FormApp, how they can use it, and how would they want to use it. And after 2 months of research, we pivoted from FormApp to “App F”, a business
process management app for modern companies.<br/>We are still working on “App F”, and we are really confident of what we are coming up with. Right now, our tentative completion date for the prototype is September End. We will be looking for
what is called a “Seed investment” after that. I’ll link our product’s deck over here, in case anyone is interested in, drop me a PM.<br/>“App F” product deck - “App F”
