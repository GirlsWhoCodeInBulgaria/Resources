Dear All,


The first Bulgarian Django Girls event passed and we already miss its spirit, curiosity and motivation. But we keep the spirit high with the thought that we can organise more editions and meet you on other occasions.


Tell us what you think of the event
We will be grateful if you take a few minutes to share your opinion about the event and how can we do better next time. We already know we can make some things better next time, but we know there are others, so your perspective is very important. 
Please reply to this e-mail and answer the following questions to let us know what you think. The more honest you are to yourself and to us, the more useful to us is your opinion. Be critical.


What do you think about the event?


What do you think about the mentor that you had?


What are your suggestions for future events?


Can we use what you wrote here as a testimonial?



Keep in touch on #slack
Last but not least, it is essential to keep in touch. This will help with motivation and answers to some issues you may have.


And of course, have fun! 
Keep calm, keep learning and keep coding,
The Django Girls Sofia Organisers
