Code is the information interpreted to create computer software, apps and websites. In order to tell the computer what you want, you have to speak to the computer in a language it understands.

The two types of code to begin using in discovering how coding works are HTML and CSS. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is a computer language that allows website rendering. HTML is a series of characters typed into a text file by using tags.

Once the file is complete with code, it is saved and viewed through an internet browser. The browser then reads the file and translates the text into a visible format, your website. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and is used along-side an HTML file to customize the style of your website. CSS brings all the colors, backgrounds, font sizes, and more to life.

### Frontend Vs. Backend
Knowing the lingo is a huge part of learning how to code. Frontend is the development of those elements of a website that the customer sees and interacts with directly. In general, it’s a combination of programming skills and aesthetics, understanding element arrangements on the screen, the color and font choices. These visuals are a mix of HTML and CSS that we discussed earlier, as well as Javascript.

Backend is a part of the application that is never visible to the user and is built with use of server-side language and databases. Backend programs include Ruby, Python and Java. To simplify, frontend code interacts with the user in real time while backend code interacts with a server to return user ready results.

### Java is Not JavaScript
Think of it this way: “Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpet.” Java is a backend programming language, while javascript is a frontend. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network.

JavaScript is the most advanced language alongside HTML and CSS and enables us to interact with users in form of sliders, drop-down menus, quizzes, and many more interactive elements. With JavaScript, the sky’s the limit.

### Get to Know Github
Wonder why developers love GitHub so much? GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. But to really understand GitHub, you need to understand what a “git” is. “Git” is a version control system. A version control system is when developers are creating something they are making constant changes to the code and releasing new versions, up to and after the first official release.

GitHub is more than a programmer’s tool: it is a collaboration between programmers, like a social networking site. You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by “following” their accounts. If you’re getting into programming, you should start to build your GitHub profile as soon as possible.
