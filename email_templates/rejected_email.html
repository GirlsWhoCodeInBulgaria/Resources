Hello,

Unfortunately we are unable to accept your application for this edition of Django Girls Sofia, but you are short-list!

Although we were unable to accept you for this edition, you are a short list of candidates will be contacted if a vacancy.
Usually this happens and it becomes clear within the next 2-3 days.
If that happens, we will send an email and in case you will have to confirm that you will attend.

If this does not happen - read below.

If there is one thing we want to remember after reading this email, it is:

Do not give up to pursue his interest in this field. On the contrary - this seemingly negative response should stimulate you more. N
othing should stop you. This event is not magical. The magic lies in yourself - in your own inner motivation. If you have, you will manage without our help.

Below this text will give explanations how we assessed what could be the possible reasons you're not among the approved and what they recommend you do from here - links to materials and resources, and opportunities for contact with people from the craft, to guide you. We will mention some tips.

How do we select candidates?

This is the most difficult moment for us in the organization of this event - to assimilate your application as motivation and likelihood to develop in the area only on the basis of a few sentences text without you know personally - and then refuse to most part of the applicants. We want to hold an event in which we can accept every request to participate, but unfortunately at the moment it is impossible. Also, there is always a subjective point that we can not eliminate, despite all our efforts.
WHAT are the possible reasons not approved your application?

To be able to accomplish approach to each participant places us are very limited, a big interest. For the current edition we have about 30 seats and have several times more applications.

We prioritized candidates with no or a small initial experience, which, however, have shown a high degree of motivation and / or prospects for development.
However, there are inevitable element of subjectivity in the evaluation process. That you are not qualified does not mean that it is not for this area. Rather it means that we assume that the event will not be as suitable for you.
For each application we can give a personal explanation why no one accepted participating. In some cases, this definitely has, in other you are a candidate and not just you came little to qualify. In any event, if you want to write a personal reason, simply reply to this email and ask us. It is possible to delay the answer because of the workload, but we promise to answer :)
Some possible causes to receive this e-mail are:
Someone is ahead with stronger motivation or earlier registration.

We have carefully reviewed each application and motivation and have separate opinion. It is not in our power to send each individual letter why the nomination is not approved, but feel encouraged to respond to this email and ask us why - will gladly respond as soon as possible.

Many options to learn programming are free online courses on Youtube, Coursera. Nowadays, there's really no excuse for someone not to learn something new if you ask.

With warmest regards,
The team of Django Girls Sofia
